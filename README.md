PROJECT 1: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning. (Google Collaboratory , Machine learning Models)

Heart disease is a leading global health challenge, and early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and prevention. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more. By analyzing these features, the models aim to assist clinicians in making data-driven decisions for early intervention. Among the tested models, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 88%, making it the most reliable model for this dataset. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.



PROJECT 2: UK Train Rides (SQL , PowerBI , Excel)

This project analyzes mock train ticket data for National Rail in the UK (Janâ€“Apr 2024), covering details such as ticket types, journey times, departure and arrival stations, and ticket prices. The analysis was conducted using SQL to derive key insights, while Power BI and Excel were utilized to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. Key metrics and trends, including ticket sales, revenue breakdowns, station popularity, and delay impacts, were extracted and presented in an actionable report. The project includes SQL code, results, and dashboards to effectively visualize and interpret the data.
