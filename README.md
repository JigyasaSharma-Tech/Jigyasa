PROJECT 1: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning. (Google Collaboratory , Machine learning Models)

Heart disease is a leading global health challenge, and early diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and prevention. This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more. By analyzing these features, the models aim to assist clinicians in making data-driven decisions for early intervention. Among the tested models, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 88%, making it the most reliable model for this dataset. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in healthcare to improve diagnostic efficiency and patient outcomes.



PROJECT 2: UK Train Rides (SQL , PowerBI , Excel)

This project analyzes mock train ticket data for National Rail in the UK (Janâ€“Apr 2024), covering details such as ticket types, journey times, departure and arrival stations, and ticket prices. The analysis was conducted using SQL to derive key insights, while Power BI and Excel were utilized to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. Key metrics and trends, including ticket sales, revenue breakdowns, station popularity, and delay impacts, were extracted and presented in an actionable report. The project includes SQL code, results, and dashboards to effectively visualize and interpret the data.

PROJECT 3: Audible Inc. Dataset (Google Collaboratory , K-MEANS , Random Forest , Logistic and Linear Regression , Correlation Analysis)

This dataset from Audible Inc. captures user engagement patterns, including audiobook completions, ratings, reviews, and social sharing behaviors. The analysis focuses on identifying key trends in audiobook popularity, user preferences, and listening habits. Techniques such as correlation analysis, regression models (Linear, Logistic, and Random Forest), and K-Means clustering were applied to segment users based on genre preferences and predict audiobook consumption. Additionally, we did churn prediction, retention analysis, and platform-based insights (iOS vs. Android). The findings highlight the most popular genres across different user segments, preferred listening times, and the impact of social engagement on audiobook discovery. Based on the insights, strategic recommendations include optimizing content acquisition for high-engagement genres, personalizing recommendations to boost retention, and targeted marketing to reduce churn.
